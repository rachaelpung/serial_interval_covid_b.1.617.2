# Serial intervals observed in SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 variant cases

This repository contains code and data to compare the serial interval in the recent COVID-19 cases infected with the B.1.617.2 variant with COVID-19 identified before Apr 2020 (i.e. prior to the occurrence of the major global SARS-CoV-2 variants). The analysis is confined pairs of a primary case and a secondary case occurring among household members.

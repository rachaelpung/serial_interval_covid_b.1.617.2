# Serial intervals observed in SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 variant cases

This repository contains code and data to compare the serial interval in the recent COVID-19 cases infected with the B.1.617.2 variant with COVID-19 identified before Apr 2020 (i.e. prior to the occurrence of the major global SARS-CoV-2 variants). The analysis is confined pairs of a primary case and a secondary case occurring among household members.

## Quick start guide
Data for the serial interval observed in household pairs of recent COVID-19 cases infected with the B.1.617.2 variant and cases identified before Apr 2020 are:

householdPair_b.1.617.2.csv<br/>
householdPair_preLD.csv

R scripts to perform the analysis and plots are:

serial_interval.R<br/>
serial_interval_plot.R
